The game of mastermind starts with the computer creating a randomized sequence of 4 elements: red, green, blue, and yellow. Colors can be repeated in a sequence of 4.

They are abbreviated by their first letter, so a sequence could look like: rggb for "red, green, green, blue".

Your job is to guess the correct sequence of four colors.

A guess might look like: gbby

The game ends when you guess the correct sequence.

You can enter q to quit at anytime.
